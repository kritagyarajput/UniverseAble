# UniverseAble

A _Sustainable App_ that tracks the carbon footprint of users. The score can be broken down into 5 categories :
* Home : Members, size of the house
* Food : Meat, vegan, veg and prepacked food
* Water : Appliances and their frequency
* Transport : By means of your personal car, public and air travel.
* Misc : Recycling, waste production per week and major purchases per year. 

Carbon footprint is basically an estimatino of CO2 generated by a people and released to the environment. 
Carbon emission is one the main causes of global warning. Hence, this app is a small initiative to this fight!

This app was made with **flutter** as the front-end and **python** as the back-end.

Here are some of the screenshots from our application :
