Hackers of the Galaxy.

A Sustainable App that tracks the carbon footprint of users. The score can be broken down into 5 categories :
* Home
* Food
* Water
* Transport
* Misc

Carbon footprint is basically an estimatino of CO2 generated by a people and released to the environment. 
Carbon emission is one the main causes of global warning. Hence, this app is a small initiative to this fight!
